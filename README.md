## Requirements

- Node.js
- Git


## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:classdojo/mojo-starter.git && cd mojo-starter && npm install;
```

## Building

To build your application, simply run:

```
npm run build
```

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug your application is run:

```
npm start
```

This will open up an http server `http://localhost:8080` which you can visit in your browser.

You can also use the built-in hotswap script which will automatically refresh all resources if they change:

```
npm run hotswap
```

Note that the above command assumes that you're already running `npm start`.
